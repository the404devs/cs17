# Interactive Course Simulator: Computer Science 2017
## June 5, 2017

A very meta final project from Grade 11. Play as a computer science student and join the cooky cast of characters that was our Grade 11 class in your journey to learn whatever it was we learned that year. Very rushed, and as a result very buggy. As I recall, losing to the final boss traps you in a permanent state of computer science limbo because we forgot to program any sort of behavior for that situation. We ended up getting 102% on this one, thanks to bonus marks from a popularity contest, where everyone in the class voted for their favourite final project. As literally everyone in the class appears in this game, ours was naturally the most popular. We got some more bonus marks from winning the Robocode tournament with our seizure-inducing rainbow coloured tanks.

Made in colaboration with Kevin and Jatin (thanks guys!)

The website I have here is a super early version, and it looks like the finished product is lost forever. Jatin is the one who worked on it, and his old flash drive seems to be borked. Neither Kevin or myself had a backup copy.
